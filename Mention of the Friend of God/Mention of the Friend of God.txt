I was entering a room during the month of Scorching, or Ramadan, 
in a blessed house, 
there was a man wearing clean clothes sitting in the room, on a couch, by himself.

I did not know who the man was.
There was a woman, sitting on another couch in the room.
It had appeared that the man delivered a book and a computer, to the house, maybe for the woman.


I had remembered, by the Grace of God, of some things, before entering the room.
So, I quietly recited a supplication, to my Lord, as I entered the room;
One that I learned from Prophet Moses, peace and blessings be upon him (Quran 2:67):

"I seek refuge in God from being amongst the ignorant."

It had appeared that the man sitting on the couch had heard my supplication,
and after I walked in the room, I may have said some things to both of them, 
and all that I remember him saying to me was:

"You're really His Friend, aren't you?"

He may or may not have smiled at me, and he seemed very calm;
And I don't remember seeing him move.

I had then remembered, by the Grace of God, after what the man said, 
about the Title Given to Prophet Abraham, 
peace and blessings be upon him,
peace and blessings be upon his sons,
and I wanted to share my Lord's Words with the nice man (Quran 4:125).

So, I asked the man if he knew that God gave Prophet Abraham that Title,
Friend of God.

I believe the man did smile at me, then.

I remember leaving the room after that, God knows what I did afterwards.
